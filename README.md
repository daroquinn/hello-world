this is intimidating lmao

I'm here because I'm trying to learn to use SBURB Legacy, which is an HTML5 engine produced by WhatPumpkin for the explicit purpose of creating Homestuck-style walkabouts.  It's intimidating.  I took one university-level HTML class, but the person teaching it wasn't really qualified, honestly.
